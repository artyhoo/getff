# AGENTS.md — framework contributor context (off-CC harnesses)

> **Authoritative for:** off-CC session context for contributors to this framework; portable rule index (§Rules).
> **NOT authoritative for:** project goal — see [README.md#why-this-exists](README.md#why-this-exists). CC-specific session boot — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) (auto-loaded by Claude Code at session start).

Universal format read by Cursor, Codex CLI, Aider, Windsurf, and other non-CC harnesses.
**Claude Code users:** `CLAUDE.md` is your authoritative entry doc — CC auto-loads it AND `.claude/rules/*.md`. Read this file only if working across harnesses or onboarding off-CC.

## What this project is

**Goal:** AI agents can't silently bypass undocumented conventions. Every codified rule is an executable artifact (ESLint rule, pre-push check, principle test, mutation gate, drift probe) that fails at the earliest reachable channel — edit-time → pre-commit → pre-push → CI → production audit. CI is the last resort, not the primary gate. Full statement: [README.md#why-this-exists](README.md#why-this-exists).

**Methodology:** recursive self-application — the framework validates itself with its own logic.

## Session start (Step 0)

1. Read [README.md#why-this-exists](README.md#why-this-exists) — the project goal.
2. Read [.claude/session-bootstrap.md](.claude/session-bootstrap.md) — goal restatement + invariants (compaction-resilient).
3. Read the rules below that apply to your task.

## Rules

**On Claude Code:** `.claude/rules/*.md` auto-load at session start — no manual action needed.
**On other harnesses (Cursor, Codex, Aider, Windsurf):** these rules do NOT auto-load. Read the ones relevant to your task from the list below before starting.

<!-- getff:begin section=rule-index plan=scripts/render-rule-index.mjs -->
One line per rule — full text: read `.claude/rules/<name>.md` (index: `.claude/rules/00-rule-index.md`).

| Rule | Class | Fires | Channel(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ai-laziness-traps.md` | A | any R-phase, audit, sample-based investigation, or open-ended AI task. | always-on core |
| `attention-is-not-a-mechanism.md` | C | designing any load-bearing check (gate vs. bare human/AI attention). | always-on core |
| `autonomous-loop-continuity.md` | B | unattended turn ending with work in flight. | hook |
| `build-first-reuse-default.md` | A | any capability commit / new-capability proposal. | always-on core |
| `ci-tool-pinning.md` | A | editing `.github/workflows/**` or any repo shell script (`*.sh`, `setup`, `install.sh`). | paths:(6), edit-time inject |
| `companion-install-principle.md` | B | editing `setup.d/**` (companion install manifest/engine). | paths:(1), edit-time inject |
| `destination-environment-verification.md` | B | kickoff authoring; accepting container work. | paths:(1), edit-time inject |
| `doc-authority-hierarchy.md` | A | creating/editing any canonical or shipped consumer-facing doc. | paths:(4), edit-time inject |

| `egress-no-api-bypass.md` | B | harvesting/egressing a finished aif-agent branch to a PR. | skill-embed |
| `evidence-regeneration.md` | B | a per-backend toolchain-freshness gate goes RED (`checkToolchainFreshness` — the committed evidence `toolchain` string ≠ the version resolving at test time), OR a rendered-not-fired matrix cell needs its first live-fired evidence. | paths:(1), edit-time inject |
| `git-conflict-merge-forward.md` | B | a PR turns CONFLICTING (`mergeable_state: dirty`) because the base branch moved ahead; any urge to `git rebase` and/or `git push --force*` a published PR branch. | claude-md |
| `kickoff-staging-placement.md` | B | editing/creating any file under `.claude/orchestrator-prompts/<umbrella>/`. | paths:(1), edit-time inject |
| `language-discipline.md` | A | writing any internal machinery or human-facing output. | paths:(3), edit-time inject |
| `memory-codification.md` | B | writing a durable behavioural convention to agent memory. | hook |
| `no-paid-llm-in-ci.md` | A | editing `.github/workflows/**` or `.github/actions/**`. | paths:(2), edit-time inject |

| `reviewer-discipline.md` | C | review sessions (`/review`, `/ultrareview`, or a prose "проверь"/verdict ask). | agent |
| `rule-enforcement-channel-selection.md` | A | codifying any new rule / choosing its enforcement channel. | paths:(2), edit-time inject |
| `skill-description-quality.md` | C | authoring/updating any SKILL.md `description` field. | paths:(1), edit-time inject |
| `source-before-shape.md` | B | creating a new SKILL.md/agent/module, or authoring a dispatch/kickoff. | paths:(3), edit-time inject |
| `zcode-parity-doctrine.md` | A | editing `.claude/hooks/**`, `plugin/hooks/**`, or `scripts/render-harness-config.mjs`; authoring Wave B stage kickoffs or research patches under `docs/meta-factory/zcode-parity-mega.*.md` / `docs/meta-factory/research-patches/2026-07-18-zcode-parity-*.md`. | paths:(10), edit-time inject |

### Configuration access

Read configuration through the injected config accessor, never std::env::var directly
<!-- @nodes: no-direct-env-var -->

## Time handling

_Generated demo region (MT stage 4): fixture conventions rendered from Convention IR; enforcement lines are derived from live RenderOutcomes — see spec §5.1._

### Time handling

Use an injected clock, not datetime.datetime.now() directly

> Never (fires): import datetime
x = datetime.datetime.now()
> Always (clean): x = clock.now()
